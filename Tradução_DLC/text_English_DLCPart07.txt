1967074360	Why can´t I be the one with the a plan for once, amigo?
1917499803	I swear, this is the last time, I´m gonna help that stupid ox.

1938540396	You look kinda familiar... bah, forget it.
352987679	We're gonna make an example of you.
1154785013	What the hell? Where is he?
1012088109	Shit, we gotta find him!
1622357829	Hey, amigo! Over here!
1837530854	Damn it. Be quiet.
1805650070	So how's that plan of yours looking now? Got anything to say for yourself?
1280245421	Relax, amigo. Everything went just as planned.
1260826349	Like hell it did! And why'd I have to wear this damn suit?!
668953037	Let’s just go over there. I’ll talk you through.
316844345	Alright amigo listen up. The best part starts now.
815364192	You´re still trying to tell me this is all part of your plan?
340814181	Of course it is! Just listen.
691516046	Me and Rosie are pretty sure they keep the money in that tower.
2016045829	All we have to do is get in there, crack the lock on the door and bingo!
1299856801	And how exactly are WE going to crack the lock?
1097306597	You think it´s a coincidence they took Doc inside after they caught him?
1879267963	I think you should put off on that whiskey you have in your flask.
1416215396	Okay, so Doc´s in there, fine.
973304880	How are WE supposed to get in there?
1919886351	We use the cannon.
689649012	That thing? Who says it's even loaded?!
2051422095	There's a box of cannonballs right around here. We just gotta carry it to the cannon and boom!
181343544	Great... 
1847643261	... but what about Kate and Isabelle?
1977615547	Isabelle is up there. I think they're all still scared of her after that show she put on.
460711541	And Kate is over there. I think the big guy has fallen in love with her. Heh, idiot.
1861807150	She better change out of that wedding dress though...
1074081425	And that's about it.
1469164829	Open the gate, free Doc, get into the tower and hello retirement!
1868915384	And maybe free the others who are about to get killed because of you.
398820561	Sure. Maybe that too.
144886635	By the way, where the hell did your Rosie disappear to?
1692892948	Ah! She’s also part of the plan. You'll see, it's gonna be great.
1475910060	I think she saw how shit your plan was and said "screw this, I'm leaving." 
1831242200	She would never do that! I know it in my heart, amigo!
1010574852	Think I see Kate.
972398662	Come on, Kate’s this way.
1479250160	That’s Kate over there.
938554196	I can't believe you talked her into proposing to that guy.
2122825766	Heh, right? Rosie loved the idea, too.
688501530	Oh, I bet she did. That's why she's here right now, helping us.
1349571365	Relax, amigo.
2069632375	Don't worry, the priest will be here soon.
1951226312	We don't have any rings, but I'm sure that's alright with you.
228957132	Wait until you get to know the boys. They'll love you.
480804693	You can be proud. You're marrying the strongest, most handsome man around.
1293306735	You can cook, right? Of course you can, I mean look at you.
35199416	What's taking that damn priest so long...
595972476	Wait what? Shit! My bride!
44568144	Find her!
2055338766	You took your sweet time.
1209414223	Don’t worry. I got you.
1216497781	Hold still, we got you.
1078635164	God this is embarrassing
1434347750	Hector! Damn it, what took you so long?!
1088918614	Heh, sorry about that.
1377818807	You better cut me loose right now!
847203795	Remind me never to listen to one of your plans again.
111169968	Come on Kate, you did great! Heh, that big guy even called a priest.
541776335	Can someone please shut him up before I forget myself?
1722334228	Huh? What did I say?
2113431443	Let's just move on.
1815655449	We cut through here, we get to the fortress.
185525359	Through here, to the fortress.
561948202	Fortress is this way.
832911167	Wouldn’t mind taking the clothes off that lady so I can disguise myself.
1760262285	She just walks up to him and says "I wanna marry you."
326889129	Bullshit!
1629533943	I swear to God, I was there.
1570107384	Damnit! Lucky bastard.
1328874239	You hear about that witch they caught over at the camp.
1660395588	Ain't no such thing, as a witch.
1244259482	Tell that to them. Said they're gonna burn her or something.
286321581	Eh, they're just messing with you.
76297247	They brought that shady fellah into the nest.
897998457	Sounds like Morgan is gonna have some fun with him.
405827216	He had this bag... Leonard pulled it open and poof! Exploded right in his face.
347782645	Heh, serves him right the idiot.
31915650	Finally something other that damn wedding dress.
