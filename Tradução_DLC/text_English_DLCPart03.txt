1709304919	I'm waiting.
483538927	How am I supposed to work with you constantly yelling in my ears?
787184426	Just open it, alright?
1584416006	I'm on it, Cass. Relax.
993672428	Is it open yet?
1332824998	What's it look like smartass?
222575628	Uh... not open?
1291261267	Just let me work, Jesus.
1103802751	How's he doing?
2038428487	Ask him.
1789273480	Hey Butch! How are you doing?
1701212537	Shut up and make your rounds.
1356906179	Still?
1427950506	Yup.
696682202	Hey Butch!
774178509	One more word, and I'll crack this open with your skull!
220018265	This is taking forever.
1263721438	Ugh, tell me about it.
283430914	You need anything now?
266158854	The only thing I require is SILENCE!
1564635340	Alright, let's see what we've got.
1292847304	Hrm.
1125921543	What? What's wrong?
760730558	The damn thing is empty. All that's in here is a note.
688570029	Wonderful.
249881902	Let's head back to Rosie.
1144786249	Let's fetch Cooper and head back to Rosie.
1889591150	She better have an explanation for this.
109488112	Welcome back.
569979334	There she is! Amigo, say hello to my lovely Rosie!
509371406	Hey there, Miss. Sorry I don't remember you from Baton Rouge. My memory, y'know's a bit hazy.
260862792	Oh, don't you trouble your little head Mr. Cooper. It happens to the best of us.
81203496	Rosie, the vault was empty. All we found was a note.
1104832070	I feared as much. Can I see it?
281717185	You telling me you KNEW this would happen?
1657860207	I had a hunch. Now, let's see...
357235499	What does it say, honey?
1174650106	"To whomever lowlife scum this may concern, I suggest you remove yourself from my brother's property and go back to digging in the dirt where you belong."
1082676112	Signed: "Magnus Hieronymus DeVitt."
1962075237	Looks like the hunt is just getting started.

1728706167	Find the Switch on the Statue
2056762711	Get to the statue in the front yard. There's a hidden switch on it that does... something.
1034617777	Pick up Cooper (Optional)
456779033	Cooper is waiting at the entrance. Go say hello.
941098583	Crack the Safe
786314742	The vault has been revealed beneath the fountain. McCoy can crack the safe.
2057191596	Disguise A
2088523610	There's a disguise for Kate in the pit.

1024967519	There's a disguise for Kate in the garden.

265455246	In the first part of "Money for the Vultures", the gang reunites once again to hunt down Vincent DeVitt's hidden riches./n/nHelp them uncover a mysterious vault, avoid bloodthirsty looters, and find out if the enigmatic Rosie from Baton Rouge can really be trusted, or if she has her own interests in mind.
72555366	Three months after the showdown at Devil's Canyon, the gang comes together once more./n/nA message from Hector promises a lucrative deal: a hunt for the hidden riches of Vincent DeVitt./n/nThey arrive at DeVitt's estate, now tarnished by neglect and the hands of greedy looters./n/nWith them is the mysterious Rosie, a dubious aquaintance from their escapades in Baton Rouge... 
1549737372	Three months after the showdown at Devil's Canyon, the gang reunites for a special job./n/nRosie, a dubious aquaintance from Baton Rouge, wants their help to hunt down the hidden treasure vault of Vincent DeVitt./n/nOn returning to the now abandoned Casa DeVitt, the gang must now make their way through bloodthirsty looters to the statue in the front yard./n/nA hidden switch on the statue is supposed to reveal the vault. Once that's done, the only thing left to do is clear it out. Oh, and Cooper is somewhere too.
1972791255	Bring Rosie a present.
1497331362	Bring Rosie a dress.
1294823371	Don't meet up with Cooper.
340212994	Nobody ever did anything just for money.
1087297469	I admit, sometimes it's hard to justify the lengths I go to.
787239786	Snatching Vincent DeVitt's hidden wealth from under a few looters' noses sounded easy enough.
1133525180	Turns out his brother Magnus cleared out the vault long before we came.
474428530	Lucky for us, I know where to find Magnus DeVitt.
532289047	Though I hadn't planned on returning to Louisiana for quite some time...
1324959016	Piss off! And don't you come back again!
2067274862	No luck. Unsurprisingly, Mr. DeVitt will not receive us.
495576672	Was that guy mean to you?! I'm gonna twist his head off!
1108652645	Relax, darling. We'll just have to resort to Plan B.
1190890082	Sounds like you could use a bit of a helping hand.
1743621451	Belle!
525813077	Hey there!
160748737	Glad you could make it!
2063767261	Just so you know, I put in a good word for you.
1118808665	That's mighty sweet of you, sunshine.
893284116	Well, hello there, Rosie.
1162802782	Isabelle, so good to see you again.
1076754197	That so?
663438587	Please, I was just about to explain the plan, if you don't mind.
1866064282	By all means.
1867019390	Right, now as far as I know, Mr. DeVitt is currently on the roof of his mansion. 
1756016296	Head up there and make him tell you where the money is.
287312234	A warning though. You'll need a key to get up there. You'll find it in the garden.
1489773450	There should also be one or two disguises around, if you wish to use one.
1177045700	Pretty well informed, as always.
645887104	See? I said we can count on my Rosie!
2073334627	Why thank you, Hector.
705478934	Now, I will be waiting here as usual. Good luck.
1770418093	Sunshine, would you do me a favor and keep an eye on my old friend here?
257020204	For her own safety, of course.
1655882832	Of course.
415167592	Don't worry Doc. She's great company.
1851552262	Oh, I bet.
2111831061	DEVITT COTTON PLANTATION
1977065917	Let's see where this takes us.
1376135008	Let's slip in discretely, shall we?
215473589	Come on, the money's waiting.
1090506123	So, you're working with Rosie Adams. I hope you know what you're in for.
1174008409	Oh, we do. We actually had a little encounter with her back in Baton Rouge.
2075266149	Wait. Don't tell me SHE's the one who put something in your drinks?
1961361628	Heh, yeah. I still don't remember how we got that cow on the roof.
927182866	Well, let's focus on getting inside.
243525223	And we're in.
1996767205	We're in.
1411272496	I'm in. Nice.
792351549	Okay, I'm in.
1151783108	Hey, listen, don't worry about the workers here. I sent word we're coming. They're not gonna rat us out.
2062980646	Sounds like you got a few friends around here.
149736502	Let's call it a reputation.
102232804	What do you think the boss brought back from New Mexico?
1578282633	Don't know, don't care.
345483893	Comeon, Freddy. Ain't you just a bit curious.
2034911439	Never pays to stick your nose in someone else's business. Especially DeVitt business.
829078667	So how's the air up there?
1731872078	Very funny. Ain't you got patrol duty?
868043868	They closed the gate to the garden. I ain't gonna walk all the way around.
2023043705	Suit yourself.
856783855	Something's going on at the chapel.
92700561	Eh, the workers are nosy again, who cares.
1802995305	Yeah. They've been giving me the look all day. Wonder what's wrong.
1653419427	You gotta learn to relax, buddy.
1465499533	What are you doing up there anyway?
1002434623	I can see better from up here.
1414462688	What if you hear something suspicious?
373380709	I ignore it, what else do you think I'll do?
1824252542	Argh, aw man.
1812110440	Hmm.
